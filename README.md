# COOP-Netflix-Group-Project
* Performed analysis on Netflix movie data ranging from 2012-2016 in a group of 5 to provide recommendations on the best Movies that Netflix should be putting out during this time frame based on different KPIs, seasons, and Directors utilizing Excel as our primary data analysis tool and Tableau to visualize.

* Profit, Year and ROI columns were not included in the original dataset. This was added by me and my group.

## Key Highlights
* Netflix should invest in the top three genres with the top 5-7 popular directors and release it during popular year and all these measurements are based off profit/ROI
* Top 3 Genres were Action, Comedy and Sci-Fi
* Top years were in 2014, and 2016
* Top months were June, July and May (We figured this was holiday seasons/when people have more free time to watch movies)
* Best Director by far was Chris Renaud
